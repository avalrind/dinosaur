## Overview 

Dinosaur is Python Library for faster Animated Data Analysis. The Library is still in its earliest-stages, so expect it to be buggy and unpredictable.

## Installation 

Just use this command 

```
pip install git+https://github.com/avalrind/dinosaur
```

## Usage 

Currently Dinosaour only supports Lineplots

```
import dinosaur as dino 

dino.lineplot(
    list(range(100)) , 
    list(range(100))
)
```

## Contribution 

We highly encourage contributions to make Dinosaur better. Got something to add. Just create a Pull Request
